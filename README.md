# OMI (Open Macro Input)

Welcome to you in this project.

Open Macro input is a life time project I started a bit before 2020.  
My plan is to refactor it slowly for two year (2021-2022) then to start making a stable version.  

Until, I decide a license for the project, it is open source and free to use under beerware license.  
But I keep all right on projet until I can decided myself.   

If you do a commercial use of this tool contact me.   
If you do and don't contact me. At least send me some beer or coffee some time:

My the code be with you.

Kind regards,
Éloi Strée
